h2. Get the (js) lead out

Okay, it's been pretty long since I've posted something, but I'm back.
My most recent posts were javascript oriented and specifically dealt
with Backbone.

Looking back at them, I'm actually tempted to take them offline because
they're simply inaccurate in far too many ways. Because they represent
a learning process, and ultimately led me to this post, I'm going
to leave them though.

In this post I'm going further with javascript. I'm going to explore
how to get inline javascript out of your project. I've read plenty
about the fact that you're not supposed to write it, but haven't found
anything about how to get it out.

Let's start with the typical blog app, do the scaffolding for Posts
and then starting experimenting with my @.coffee@ files.

so:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1809695.js?file=gistfile1.txt"></script>

We'll start simple. Let's see if we can just add jQuery selectors to
our @posts.js.coffee@

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1809646.js"> </script>

Nice. I suck at coffee script, so this actually took me a while, but
it works.

I'll look at building on this the next time, and I'll add the links
here.

Perhaps exploring things like if jQueryUI (i.e. sortable) or if more
complex views with multiple partials will work will need to be
addressed first, but ultimately, I want to deal with abscractions
dealing with @data-@ attributes
