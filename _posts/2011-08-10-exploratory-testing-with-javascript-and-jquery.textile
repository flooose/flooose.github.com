title: Exploratory testing with javascript and jquery

I've been frustrated by my inability to get a confident head-wrap around javascript. Part of it is that at my job, we do most of our javascript stuff with well developed libraries (i.e. rails unintrusive javascript and jquery). This allows us to do what I believe is pretty common practice in the world of web application development: we get enought familiarity with the library and with google to be able accomplish what we want with a lot of copy and pasting, trial and error, and page reloads.

I too have come a long way (from zero experience) with this method, but when I run into something that we have to implement, and I can't borrow from our existing javascript or find an example on the internet, I find myself guessing and wishing and all to often spending WAY too much time at this.

When I encounter something like this in other code (ruby, for instance) I have the luxury of recognizing that I am in over my head and falling back on the time tested solution: "Let's write a test". I'm talking about an exploratory test here though, not a unit test or a cucumber feature. Being new to being a full-fledged rails developer, I've done this a lot, and learned a lot, and in a structure, sane way.

I haven't figured out how to go about doing this with javascript and jquery though, so when I see code like "this":http://linkhere.com or "this":http://linkhere.com, I'm left with little extra choice but to fall back on the "poke and hope"
