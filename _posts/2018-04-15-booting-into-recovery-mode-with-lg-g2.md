## Booting into Recovery Mode on LG G2

Doing an internet search on this topic yields many results and all of them
correctly state, that, when the device is shut off, you simply **hold the volume
down button and power putton simultaneously** then when the LG logo appears, you
**shortly release these buttons and press them simultaneously again**.

Unfortunately, this doesn't work, when the cable for charging the device is
connected. This is often the case when we're debugging or installing custom
ROMs, so avoid this pitfall in the future.
