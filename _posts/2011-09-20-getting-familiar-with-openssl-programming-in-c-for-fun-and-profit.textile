h2. Openssl in C for fun and profit

I'm going to write a small password utility in C. It's going to read a string from the command line and password encrypt it. It will also have the abilitiy to decrypt said string. I'm doing this because I'm writing a small library that requires some encryption and I haven't been able to make it work with the help of google searches and ruby documentation. There is more Openssl documentation out there in C than Ruby, so if I can make it work here, then I think I'll stand a better chance of making work in my ruby project.

Besides, it will give me an excuse to brush up on C, and who doesn't want that.
