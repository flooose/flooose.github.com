## My Basic Sourdough Bread

This is my basic sourdough bread recipe adapted from
[here](https://www.theperfectloaf.com/beginners-sourdough-bread/). The baking is
spread over three days with minimal work on each day. The total of all
ingredients is as follows:

|Weight|Ingredient|Baker's Percentage|
|------|----------|------------------|
|489g  |Wheat Flour (Type 550)|85.94%|
|56g|Whole Wheat Flour (Type not specified)|9.84%|
|24g|Rye Flour (Type 1150)|4.22%|
|344g|Tap Water|60.46%|
|9g|Salt|1.58%|


### Day one

Some time towards late afternoon or evening feed the starter. I usually do a
50/50 mix of either rye or wheat flour with warm water, about 20g of each.

### Day two

The second day consists of taking a portion of the flour and water listed above
and mixing them with the starter after a one hour autolyse.

|Weight|Ingredient|
|------|----------|
|187g  |Wheat Flour |
|28g|Whole Wheat Flour |
|12g|Rye Flour |
|172g|Tap Water|

The water should be pretty warm. Mix it with the flour and let this sit for an
hour. This is the autolyse. After an hour has passed, mix in the starter. I use
a hand mixer to knead the dough thoroughly. Cover and let sit in a warm place
for about 5 hours. More is ok too, but it should probably not be less. After 5
hours the dough should be very active. Use a spatula to lightly pull the dough
from the sides of the bowl into the middle. Cover and refrigerate overnight.

### Day 3

Take dough out and put it in a warm place. Turning the ovenlight on or even the
oven at 35-40°C is also an option for warming the dough. Once the dough has
warmed up a bit it should show activity again.

Before adding the remaining ingredients, take some of the dough for the next
starter, about 20g should be sufficient.

Add the remaining ingredients and knead with a hand mixer. Let the bread rise
until it has a little less than doubled in size. Clear some counter space, flour
it and gently move the dough from the bowl. Stretch and fold the dough on itself
a couple of times. Line a new bowl with a floured kitchen towel and put the
dough in the bowl. Let the dough rise again until it has a little less than
doubled in size. Preheat the oven to 250°C. Gently remove the dough from the
bowl and place it on the floured work surface. With the help of the towel you
should be able to remove it from the bowl without disturbing the dough too much.

Now it's time to form the dough. The idea is to use a dough knife or something
similar to gently tuck the dough into itself on the bottom by using scraping
motions with the dough knife along the worksurface into the dough. It's
important here not to disturb the dough too much. It has risen and we want to
maintain that as much as possible.

After forming the dough, place it on a floured baking stone or baking sheet and
after the oven has preheated, place it in the oven. Splash some water into the
oven an let the bread bake for 10-15 minutes. Turn the temperature down to 200°C
and let the bread bake another 20-40 minutes until it's a dark golden brown.
