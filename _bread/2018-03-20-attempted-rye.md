## Switching from German to American Flours not so Easy

This was an attempt to recreate with American flour the German-Style rye bread I
was baking in Germany and mostly a variation of [this][rye-recipe]. In the
process I decided that German flours, especially rye flour 1050, is far too
different from the Arrowhead Mills [organic rye flour][arrowhead-rye] that I had
bought and went in a different direction, hoping to save the bread from a
complete failure.

### Summary of Ingredients

| Weight | Ingredient                    | Baker's Percentage\* |
|--------|-------------------------------|----------------------|
|        | Starter                       |                      |
| 225g   | King Arthur All Purpose Flour |                  50% |
| 225g   | Arrowhead Mills Rye Flour     |                  50% |
| 354g   | Store-bought Spring Water     |            78.6%\*\* |
| 12g    | Salt                          |                2.67% |

\* excluding starter, since the amount isn't known

\*\* this doesn't seem to be a sane value. I think I must have added some flour later

### Sourdough starter

I didn't really document the amount and the proportions of the starter. In all
likelyhood, it was my usual 50/50 mixture water and flour.

### The Scald

At the start of baking, I created a scald with the following quantities of the
total ingredients listed in the main table:

| Weight | Ingredient                    |
| 150g   | King Arthur All Purpose Flour |
| 175g   | Arrowhead Mills Rye Flour     |
| 152g   | Store-bought Spring Water     |

The scald was extremely dry. It sat 20-30 minutes

### Final Dough

After the scald had finished, the final ingredients were added to the dough.

| Weight | Ingredient                    |
| 75g    | King Arthur All Purpose Flour |
| 50g    | Arrowhead Mills Rye Flour     |
| 202g   | Store-bought Spring Water     |
| 12g    | Salt                          |

### Baking

I baked the bread at 550Â°F for 10 minutes, throwing a quarter cup water into the
interior of the oven for steam. After 10 minutes, I let out the steam an baked
to end.
