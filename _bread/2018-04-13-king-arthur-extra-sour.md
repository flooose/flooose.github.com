## King Arthur Extra Sour Sourdough

For this loaf, I used this [recipe][extra-sour] as a starting point, switching
from "volume" to "grams" units.

### Summary of Ingredients

| Weight | Ingredient                    | Baker's Percentage |
|--------|-------------------------------|--------------------|
| 191g   | 50/50-Starter                 |        11.8%/11.8% |
| 50g    | Starter Augment\*             |    3.46%/3.46%\*\* |
| 602g   | King Arthur All Purpose Flour |             83.32% |
| 340g   | Store-bought Spring Water     |             47.06% |
| 12g    | Salt                          |              1.66% |

Total hydration = 62.35% :

```lisp
(/ (+ 85.5 25 340) bread-flour)
0.6235294117647059
```

\* "Starter Augment" here simply means the recipe called for 241g of starter,
but I only had 191g. I added equal parts flour and water to the starter to
compensate for this. It was mostly an attempt to keep the hydration consistent
with the recipe.

\*\* 25g water and 25g flour

### Sourdough

The sourdough was made the night before

| Weight | Ingredient                    |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| 191g   | 50/50-Starter                 |
| 50g    | Starter Augment\*             |
| 362g   | King Arthur All Purpose Flour |
| 340g   | Store-bought Spring Water     |

I deviated from the proofing instructions in the recipe, in that I put my
proofing dough in the refrigerator right away and took it out to warm up for a
few hours the day of the bake

### Final Dough

After the proofing sourdough had warmed and sat for a few hours, the final
ingredients were added to the dough.

| Weight | Ingredient                    |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| 241g   | King Arthur All Purpose Flour |
| 12g    | Salt                          |

I let the dough sit on parchment paper in a covered dutch oven until it had
risen sufficiently.

### Baking

At 550°F for 10 minutes, with a dash of water thrown in the oven for humidity.
After that with reduced temperature of 475°F, baked until golden brown on top.
Total baking time, about 40 minutes.
